We installed some necessary libraries which were required to preprocess the data and implement LDA:

Spacy: This library is used to facilitate the implementation of NLP.

NLTK: It is also used to work with Natural Language Processing to use stop-words library, tokenize, stem and parse documents.

Pandas: To work with dataframes.

String: It has constants, utility functions and classes which are used for string manipulation

from nltk.corpus import stopwords: Used to get a list of stopwords, this is used to find a list of stopwords from the word corpus.

Gensim: Used for topic modeling which helps in the implementation of LDA.

Seaborn: It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Sklearn: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
