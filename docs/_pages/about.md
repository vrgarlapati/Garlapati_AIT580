This is Neehar Bujimalla. At present, I'm in the first semester, pursuing Masters in Data Analytics Engineering. Right from the time I've got to use the computer, I used to wonder with different thoughts like, how exactly does a computer work, how the data we manage using our computer really work, etc., that innocent interest of computers, helped me to pursue my under graduation with Computer Science and Engineering as major.
