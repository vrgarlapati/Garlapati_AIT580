I"Ð	<p>The main idea behind our project is to find and extract patterns or confidential information from the CFPB dataset A database of consumer complaints isnâ€™t worth important if the dataset cannot be used for the betterment of the experience of the consumer. The size of this data is enormous. It has numerous missing cells, which will decrease the accuracy score during training and testing by simplifying the data further so financial companies can use it to analyze the complaints to make a difference for their customers better. The consumer complaint narrative field within our dataset contains consumersâ€™ complaints in detail.</p>

<p>This data of consumer complaints is precious as we can extract intriguing information from it and conceivably give contexts to these complaints so companies can address issues in a systematized matter with the expedients to retain or gain further customers. The overall analysis can also be used by the state and federal agencies to show repetitive complaints that have not been improved over time so rules or fines can be implemented to punish companies that continue to conduct poor business practices.</p>

<p>This analysis could possibly be beneficial to three parties. First, Customers can better determine if a company is worth giving their business to Customer decision making could possibly improve with this dataset as consumers could easily track which company has been able to make constant improvements over time with complaints they have received. This could show initiative and therefore be a viable option for the customer to give their business over to their competitors. A reduction in the number of complaints means that a company has improved its ways of working to ensure better customer satisfaction which led to fewer complaints against them.
Second, CFPB can use this analysis to better understand the problems and possibly put an end to major issues through regulations by bringing them to the governmentâ€™s attention.
Most importantly, this analysis will be vital to financial companies. It will help them to work towards decreasing the number of complaints against them in a manageable and clear way. A better way to categorize these complaints and finding relationships can help companies find a trend through the vast amount of information in these narrative fields for each complaint in easy-to-follow topics once text mining methods are implemented.</p>
