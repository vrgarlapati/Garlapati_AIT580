e) What are the first 3 product types that are associated with the complaints, and try to represent them numerically using a bar graph in the month of March 2022?

f) Which three companies are facing a more significant number of complaints and try to show them with graphical representation using bars in the month of March 2022?

<p>What are the advantages and limitations of the target dataset in answering your questions?
The target dataset is extremely large, and standard computer hardware resources will be insufficient to execute tasks such as TF-IDF, SVM, and Logistic regression fitting, as well as Deep learning. And, with this type of data set, leveraging GPU or TPU resources makes it simple to train, test, and validate the data, whereas finding the correctness of data on a standard computer is difficult.</p>
