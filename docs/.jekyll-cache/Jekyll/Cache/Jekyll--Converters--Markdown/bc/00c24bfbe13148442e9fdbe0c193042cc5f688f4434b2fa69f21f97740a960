I"€<p>The main idea behind our project is to find and extract patterns or confidential information from the CFPB dataset A database of consumer complaints isnâ€™t worth important if the dataset cannot be used for the betterment of the experience of the consumer. The size of this data is enormous. It has numerous missing cells, which will decrease the accuracy score during training and testing by simplifying the data further so financial companies can use it to analyze the complaints to make a difference for their customers better. The consumer complaint narrative field within our dataset contains consumersâ€™ complaints in detail.</p>
