I"0<p>Our project’s main goal is to uncover and extract patterns or hidden data from the CFPB dataset. A database of consumer complaints is useless unless it can be used to improve the consumer’s experience. This data is huge in size. It features multiple missing cells, which will lower the accuracy score during training and testing by further simplifying the data so that financial organizations may use it to evaluate complaints and better serve their clients. Consumer concerns are detailed in the consumer complaint narrative field of our dataset.</p>
