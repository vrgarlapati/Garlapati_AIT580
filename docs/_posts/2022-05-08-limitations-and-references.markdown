Limitations:

When it comes to categorizing consumer complaint narratives with their specific items, however, firms achieve a high level of accuracy. When filtering through vast amounts of data, this information is invaluable. Companies will be able to better address and prioritize issues, while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will gain a better understanding of the financial services that afflict people.
We examined recent data. However, if mortgage complaints rise sharply while credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports rise only slightly, and if both rise close to the same level, our analysis could change. These are examples of limits to our analysis.

Provide the future work that can improve your analysis to answer your question(s). 

Our analysis can be extended to the days on which a large pool of complaints was recorded, how they were tackled, how many of them were resolved, which category they fall under in a certain company and what was the reason for that.
