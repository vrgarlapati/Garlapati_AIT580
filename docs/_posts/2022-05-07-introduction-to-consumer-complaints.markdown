Our project's main goal is to uncover and extract patterns or hidden data from the CFPB dataset. A database of consumer complaints is useless unless it can be used to improve the consumer's experience. This data is huge in size. It features multiple missing cells, which will lower the accuracy score during training and testing by further simplifying the data so that financial organizations may use it to evaluate complaints and better serve their clients. Consumer concerns are detailed in the consumer complaint narrative field of our dataset.

This consumer complaint data is valuable because we can extract interesting information from it and perhaps offer context to these concerns, allowing businesses to address issues in a systematic manner in order to keep or gain new customers. The entire study can also be utilized by state and federal agencies to highlight repeat complaints that have not improved over time, allowing for the implementation of restrictions or fines to punish companies that continue to engage in bad business practices.

This analysis could possibly be beneficial to three parties. First, Customers can better determine if a company is worth giving their business to Customer decision making could possibly improve with this dataset as consumers could easily track which company has been able to make constant improvements over time with complaints they have received. This could show initiative and therefore be a viable option for the customer to give their business over to their competitors. A reduction in the number of complaints means that a company has improved its ways of working to ensure better customer satisfaction which led to fewer complaints against them.
Second, CFPB can use this analysis to better understand the problems and possibly put an end to major issues through regulations by bringing them to the government’s attention.
Most importantly, this analysis will be vital to financial companies. It will help them to work towards decreasing the number of complaints against them in a manageable and clear way. A better way to categorize these complaints and finding relationships can help companies find a trend through the vast amount of information in these narrative fields for each complaint in easy-to-follow topics once text mining methods are implemented.
