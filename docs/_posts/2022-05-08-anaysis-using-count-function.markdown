    "complaints.Company.value_counts()[:10]

    Numerical O/p: Execute above statement

    Name: Company, dtype: int64

    complaints.Company.value_counts()[:10].plot(title = 'March 2022, Number of Complaints by Company (top 10)', kind='bar')
    plt.show()"

Graphical Representation: Execute above code

Observation: EQUIFAX, INC., TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC., Experian Information Solutions Inc., stands in the top 3 spots in the number game of recording complaints. It can be seen from the graph that there is more than 250% decrease in recording the complaints with the next highest, i.e., Bank of America which has 112k complaints.  

6.	Check how did the companies respond to their customerâ€™s complaints.

Code: 

    "complaints['Company response to consumer'].value_counts()

    Numerical O/p: 

    Closed with explanation                             2133599
    Closed with non-monetary relief                     313687

    Name: Company response to consumer, dtype: int64

    complaints['Company response to consumer'].value_counts().plot(title='March 2022, Company Response to Complaints', kind='bar')
    plt.show()"

Graphical Representation: Execute above code

Observation: It can be observed that most of the companies have closed the complaints with explanations and there were negligible number of complaints which were untimely responded and closed with relief.

7.	Visualize the Banking Companies using wordcloud.

Code: 

"from wordcloud import WordCloud
def plot_wordcloud(wordcloud1):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud1, interpolation = 'bilinear')
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()

    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    stop_words = stopwords.words('english')

    company_names = complaints.Company.values.tolist()

    wordcloud1 = WordCloud(max_font_size=None, max_words = 200, background_color="white", width=5000, height=4000, stopwords = stop_words).generate(str(company_names))

    plot_wordcloud(wordcloud)"

Output: Execute the above code
