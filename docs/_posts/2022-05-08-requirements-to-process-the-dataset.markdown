What software and hardware resources you have used in this project? 
Excel and Jupiter Notebook are the software - based resources used in this project to help you understand and visualize data. The laptop is a hardware resource, and for visualization approaches, a Lenovo laptop with an Intel i7 processor and 12 GB of RAM, as well as a Google colab GPU, TPU, was employed.

What kinds of pre-processes were needed to make use of the data, and why? 
The dataset contains numerous null values, so EDA-Exploratory data analysis (text data pre-processing) is necessary to eliminate them. By omitting this, the data shape will become smaller and easier to process.

What are the advantages and limitations of the target dataset in answering your questions?
Advantages:
- Stakeholders will be able to see how they may improve by correcting inaccuracies using our answers to queries for the target dataset. Banking firms will find it simple to work in departments with a significant volume of complaints.

- Limitations – Our target dataset restricts us to the data's properties without providing context for a complaint. This restricts those attempting to work with the dataset by requiring them to manipulate data only on the specified grounds.
The intended dataset is massive, and normal computer hardware resources will be insufficient to perform tasks like TF-IDF, SVM, Logistic regression fitting, and Deep learning. With this type of data set, employing GPU or TPU resources makes training, testing, and validating the data simple. however, finding the correctness of data on a regular computer is tough.
