# **a. Distortion in a Visualization**

In a report named 'Most and Least Expensive cities' designed in 'howmuch.com' from https://howmuch.net/articles/the-cheapest-and-most-expensive-cities-to-rent-an-apartment-us-2021/, the visualization called '*Top 25 Most and Least Expensive American Cities to Rent an Apartment*' fails to convey the data in visualisation to the user due to its the multiple colors plotting and missing data.

There are 2 flaws in this :-
- **Flaw-1** -  It does not help in understanding clearly due to the **cluttered view of data points**, which misleads the readers
    **Sol** - One solution to this is, plotting the data points clearly in 2-D view.


# **b. Misleading Interpretation**

In a journal posted in 'howmuch.com' at 'https://howmuch.net/articles/the-cheapest-and-most-expensive-cities-to-rent-an-apartment-us-2021/''
is the comparision of different cities with 25 top and 25 least expensive cities. A proper map with actual numbers will interpret the information more firmly.

Below is the flaw elaborated:- 

- **Flaw** -**Misleading the persons undertanding with missing values** 
    **Sol**- The map has plotted points but the information is not presented for every data point and legend of the points is misleading the information, instead all points to be plotted on the map correctly.
